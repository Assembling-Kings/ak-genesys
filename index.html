   The Vite dev server requires an application entrypoint which for us is pointing at the wrong path. Therefore, we
   include this file to redirect to the root of the dev server and let the proxy and FoundryVTT take care of the rest.
   Notice that this file is not copied during the production build since it's not needed.
   For more info see: https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/vite

   If you are seeing this page for more than a couple of seconds try to manually go to the root path.
   If that still doesn't work then something might be wrong.
